                    <p class="text">Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis.</p>
                    <p class="text">Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems</p>
                    <p class="text">Python is used in a lot of different industries, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Information Technology</li>
                        <li>Data Science / Analytics</li>
                        <li>Web Development</li>
                        <li>Machine Learning</li>

                    <p class="medium big-font">What do you need to know?</p>
                    <p class="text">Nothing! Python is the best language to start learning to program with.</p>
                    <p class="text">Python's syntax is very close to the everyday english language, the closest of any language.</p>
                    <p class="text">Python's locial operators such as <span class="statements">if, while, for, and, or, true, false</span> make it very easy to understand the logic behind the code you are writing.</p>
                    <p class="text">It is advisable to have basic computer knowledge and logical thinking, but that goes for anything technical related.</p>

                    <p class="text">Traditionally, when learning a new programming language you will learn how to say "Hello World!" in your code.</p>
                    <p class="text">In pythong, it looks like this:</p>
                    <p class="code-block">print("Hello World!")</p>
                    <p class="text">Thats it! Overtime your code will become more advanced and you'll know how to do more than just say hello to the world.</p>

                <header>Data Types</header>
                <p class="medium big-font">Python has 9 data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Int: This data type contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fractions or decimals). 
                        In Python, there is no limit to how long an integer value can be.</li>
                    <li>Float: This value is represented by the float class. It is a real number with a floating-point representation. 
                        It is specified by a decimal point. Optionally, the character e or E followed by a positive or negative integer 
                        may be appended to specify scientific notation.</li>
                    <li>Complex Numbers: This data type is represented by a complex class. 
                        It is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j. For example <span class="statement">2+3j</span></li>
                    <li>String: A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote, or triple-quote. 
                        In python there is no character data type, a character is a string of length one. It is represented by str class.  </li>
                    <li>List: This data type just like arrays, declared in other languages which is an ordered collection of data.
                         It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.</li>
                    <li>Tuple: Just like a list, a tuple is also an ordered collection of Python objects. 
                        The only difference between a tuple and a list is that tuples are immutable i.e. tuples cannot be modified after it is created. 
                        It is represented by a tuple class</li>
                    <li>Boolean: This data type is True or False. 
                        Boolean objects that are equal to True are truthy (true), and those equal to False are falsy (false). 
                        But non-Boolean objects can be evaluated in a Boolean context as well and determined to be true or false. 
                        It is denoted by the class bool. </li>
                    <li>Set: This data type is an unordered collection of data types that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. 
                        The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of various elements.</li>
                    <li>Dictionary: This data type takes 2 different elements, a <span class="statements">Key</span>
                    and a <span class="statements">Value</span>. These key and value elements are stored in pairs, like a dictionary stores a word and a description
                    </li>
                </ul>
